## General Questions

### Can I import the same CSS file multiple times?

**No.** Re-importing the same classes will cause errors. Each class can only be imported **once**. If you need to update a class:

1. Delete it from Elementor's Global Classes panel
2. Re-import the updated CSS

### What happens when I deactivate the plugin?

**All Elementor settings modified by the plugin are automatically restored** to their original values. Your imported global classes remain in Elementor.

### Does this work with Elementor Free or only Pro?

**Works with both** Elementor Free and Pro, as long as you have v4.0.0+ with Atomic Elements enabled.

## Import Questions

### How many classes can I import?

**Hundreds.** The plugin automatically manages limits during import. You can import large utility frameworks without issues.

### Can I import in batches?

**Yes!** This is actually recommended for large CSS files. Import 20-30 classes at a time, test them, then import more.

### What if I get errors during import?

**Try these solutions:**

- Import in smaller batches
- Check for CSS syntax errors (missing units, semicolons)
- Ensure you're not re-importing existing classes
- See our [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/common-errors)

## Performance Questions

### Will this slow down my site?

**No.** Global classes are native Elementor features. The plugin only helps import them - it doesn't add any frontend overhead.

### Does the plugin affect Elementor performance?

**No.** The plugin uses Elementor's built-in Global Classes system, so there's no performance impact.

## Compatibility Questions

### What version of Elementor do I need?

**Elementor v4.0.0 or higher** with Atomic Elements feature enabled. This includes Elementor beta versions 3.32.4+.

### What WordPress version is required?

**WordPress 5.8 or higher** is required for optimal compatibility.

### What PHP version is required?

**PHP 7.4 or higher** is required. PHP 8.0+ is recommended for better performance.

## Usage Questions

### Can I use utility classes on any Elementor element?

**Yes, on atomic elements.** You can use utility classes on:

- Headings (h1-h6)
- Paragraphs
- Div Blocks
- Buttons
- Links
- Images
- Containers

### How do I apply utility classes in Elementor?

1. Select an atomic element
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab
3. Add classes to the **CSS Classes** field
4. See instant results in the editor

### Can I combine multiple utility classes?

**Yes!** You can combine multiple classes for complex designs:

```html
<div
  class="flex items-center justify-between p-6 bg-white rounded-lg border border-gray-light"
>
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-700 text-gray-dark">Title</h1>
  <button class="btn btn-blue">Action</button>
</div>
```

## Customization Questions

### Can I modify existing utility classes?

**Yes.** To modify an existing class:

1. Delete it from Elementor's Global Classes panel
2. Create your modified version
3. Re-import through Skelementor

### Can I add my own custom utilities?

**Yes!** You can create and import your own utility classes following our [CSS writing guidelines](/css-reference/writing-css).

### What CSS properties are supported?

**Most common CSS properties** are supported including:

- Typography (font-size, font-weight, etc.)
- Spacing (margin, padding, gap)
- Layout (display, flexbox, positioning)
- Colors (color, background-color, border-color)
- Borders (width, style, radius)
- Sizing (width, height, max-width)

## Troubleshooting Questions

### My classes aren't working in the editor

**Check these:**

- Ensure Elementor v4 with Atomic Elements is enabled
- Verify classes were imported successfully
- Clear Elementor cache: **Elementor → Tools → Regenerate CSS**
- Check that you're using atomic elements

### Import keeps failing

**Try these solutions:**

- Import in smaller batches (20-30 classes)
- Check CSS syntax for errors
- Ensure you're not re-importing existing classes
- Use the nuclear reset method (delete all classes, re-import)

### Classes import but don't appear in Global Classes

**This usually means:**

- Classes were imported successfully but may have empty variants
- Check Elementor's Global Classes panel
- Some properties may not be fully supported
