## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I import the same CSS file multiple times?">
    **No.** Re-importing the same classes will cause errors. Each class can only be imported **once**. If you need to update a class:

    1. Delete it from Elementor's Global Classes panel
    2. Re-import the updated CSS
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I deactivate the plugin?">
    **All Elementor settings modified by the plugin are automatically restored** to their original values. Your imported global classes remain in Elementor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work with Elementor Free or only Pro?">
    **Works with both** Elementor Free and Pro, as long as you have <Badge color="blue" size="sm">v4.0.0+</Badge> with Atomic Elements enabled.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Import Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many classes can I import?">
    **Hundreds.** The plugin automatically manages limits during import. You can import large utility frameworks without issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import in batches?">
    **Yes!** This is actually recommended for large CSS files. Import 20-30 classes at a time, test them, then import more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I get errors during import?">
    **Try these solutions:**

    - Import in smaller batches
    - Check for CSS syntax errors (missing units, semicolons)
    - Ensure you're not re-importing existing classes
    - See our [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/common-errors)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will this slow down my site?">
    **No.** Global classes are native Elementor features. The plugin only helps import them - it doesn't add any frontend overhead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the plugin affect Elementor performance?">
    **No.** The plugin uses Elementor's built-in Global Classes system, so there's no performance impact.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
